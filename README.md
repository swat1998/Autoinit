### AutoInit

## Intriduction

This is an attempt towards initiating programs with ease and subsequent automation of many of the drirectory creation and ommiting precreated comments (this is mainly created for flutter) 

This still has some minor bugs though.

Hope this automates some of the jobs...

> This was written for a wsl platform though UNIX based code are provide feel free to go in and uncomment the code 

## Recuirements 

I have tried to keep requirements to a minimum but for all of them to fuction

- Flutter (For initiating flutter project(s))
- Python (For using initiated python project(s))

## Use

**Go to the directory and try :**
> ./autoinit --help

**To try anything else than help please call the shell script using the following example:**
> . autoinit --create flutter --name Hello

**Feel free to clone it, fork it and raise issues.**
***For some bugs please resort to single string names***
